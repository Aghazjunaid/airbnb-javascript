To find a free time slot for scheduling a meeting between two individuals based on their booked calendar times, you can compare their schedules and determine the gaps where both persons are available. Here is a simple logic in JavaScript to achieve this:

```javascript
function findFreeTime(person1, person2) {
    // Sort the booked times in ascending order
    const bookedTimes = [...person1, ...person2].sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
    
    let freeSlots = [];
    let lastEndTime = -Infinity;

    for (const [startTime, endTime] of bookedTimes) {
        if (startTime > lastEndTime) {
            freeSlots.push([lastEndTime, startTime]);
        }
        lastEndTime = Math.max(lastEndTime, endTime);
    }

    // Check if there is a gap between the last booking and the end of the day
    if (lastEndTime < 24) {
        freeSlots.push([lastEndTime, 24]);
    }

    return freeSlots;
}

// Input data for Person 1 and Person 2
const person1 = [[9, 12], [14, 15], [18, 20]]; // Person 1's booked slots
const person2 = [[10, 13], [15, 17], [19, 21]]; // Person 2's booked slots

const freeTimeSlots = findFreeTime(person1, person2);
console.log("Free Time Slots for Meeting:");
console.log(freeTimeSlots);
```

In this code:
- The `findFreeTime` function takes the booked calendar times of two persons as input and finds the free time slots where both persons are available.
- It merges the booked times of both individuals, sorts them in ascending order based on start time, and iterates through the sorted times to find the free slots.
- It then combines the free slots into an array and returns the free time slots where a meeting can be scheduled.

You can adjust the input data for `person1` and `person2` to represent their booked calendar times in the format `[[start1, end1], [start2, end2], ...]` and use the `findFreeTime` function to determine the available time slots for scheduling a meeting.
