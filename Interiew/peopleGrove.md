A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself. Here's an example using SQL:

Suppose you have a table employees with the following data:

id	name	manager_id
1	Alice	3
2	Bob	3
3	Carol	NULL
4	Dave	2
And you want to find the names of all employees and their managers. You can use a self join to achieve this:

This will return:

employee_name	manager_name
Alice	Carol
Bob	Carol
Dave	Bob
In this query, employees is aliased as e1 and e2. The join condition is e1.manager_id = e2.id, 
which matches each employee with their manager.

The CSS box model is a fundamental concept in web design and CSS. It's a box that wraps around every HTML element, and it consists of:

Content: The actual content of the box, where text and images appear.
Padding: Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.
Border: A border that goes around the padding and content.
Margin: Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.
The total width and height of an element is calculated like this:

Total element width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin
Total element height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin

suppose a user is logged out but copied the jwt token, how to nullify that token so that he is not able to use it again

JWT tokens are stateless, meaning they don't keep track of whether a user is logged in or out. Once issued, a JWT token is valid until it expires, unless you have a mechanism to check for token revocation.

To nullify a JWT token, you need to implement a token blacklist. When a user logs out, you add their token to the blacklist. Then, whenever a request comes in with a token, you check if it's in the blacklist before proceeding.

Here's a simplified example of how you might implement this in Node.js with Express and a simple in-memory store:

let tokenBlacklist = [];

app.post('/logout', (req, res) => {
  // Get the token from the request
  const token = req.headers.authorization.split(' ')[1];

  // Add the token to the blacklist
  tokenBlacklist.push(token);

  res.sendStatus(200);
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // Get the token from the request
  const token = req.headers.authorization.split(' ')[1];

  // Check if the token is in the blacklist
  if (tokenBlacklist.includes(token)) {
    return res.sendStatus(401); // Unauthorized
  }

  next();
});

MySQL and PostgreSQL (often referred to as “Postgres”) are both popular relational database management systems (RDBMS) but have some differences in features, performance, and use cases. Here is a comparison of MySQL and PostgreSQL based on various aspects:

1. Licensing:
MySQL: Owned by Oracle Corporation. Dual-licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) or a proprietary license.
PostgreSQL: Open-source and released under the PostgreSQL License, a permissive open-source license.
2. Data Types:
MySQL: Supports a wide range of data types but has limitations in some advanced data types like arrays and JSON.
PostgreSQL: Offers a rich set of built-in data types and supports custom data types, arrays, JSON, and more complex types.
3. SQL Compliance:
MySQL: Generally follows SQL standards but has some variations, especially in some advanced features.
PostgreSQL: Known for its high standard SQL compliance and supports many advanced SQL features.
4. Performance:
MySQL: Historically known for being faster in simple read-write operations.
PostgreSQL: Known for its extensibility and focus on features over performance. Performance can be optimized through configuration and tuning.
5. Scalability:
MySQL: Offers good scalability options, including replication and clustering features.
PostgreSQL: Provides advanced features like table partitioning, logical replication, and horizontal scalability options.
6. High Availability:
MySQL: Provides options for high availability like MySQL Cluster and Group Replication.
PostgreSQL: Offers robust high availability solutions like streaming replication, built-in logical replication, and tools like Patroni.
7. Extensibility:
MySQL: Has a good selection of storage engines but is more limited in terms of custom extensions.
PostgreSQL: Supports custom extensions and has a rich ecosystem of extensions developed by the community.
8. Community and Ecosystem:
MySQL: Has a large user base and community support. Many third-party tools are available.
PostgreSQL: Known for its strong community support, comprehensive documentation, and active development.
9. Suitability:
MySQL: Popular in web applications, especially where read-heavy operations are common.
PostgreSQL: Preferred for applications that require complex queries, advanced data types, and high standards compliance.

// Have the function AdditivePersistence(num) take the num parameter being passed 
// which will always be a positive integer and return its additive persistence which 
// is the number of times you must add the digits in num until you reach a single 
// digit.

// For example: 
// if num is 2718 then your program should return 2 because 
// 2 + 7 + 1 + 8 = 18 and 1 + 8 = 9 and you stop at 9.

// AdditivePersistence(123123); // 12
// > 2

// AdditivePersistence(5);
// > 0

// AdditivePersistence(98489);
// > 3

// Given a non-empty string of letters and a non-negative integer representing a key, write a function that returns a new string obtained by shifting every letter in the input string by k positions in the alphabet, where k is the key.

// Note that letters should "wrap" around the alphabet; in other words, the letter "z" shifted by one returns the letter "a" // PS

// You need to preserve the case of each alphabet as well
// Sample Input string = "xyz", key = 2 Output -> "zab"

// Sample input string = "Caesar Cipher", key = 4 Output -> "Geiwev Gmtliv"

// Helper functions below
// String.fromCharCode(65)
// 'a'.charCodeAt()


function shifter(str,key){
    let result = '';
    for(let i=0;i<str.length;i++){
        let char = str[i];
        let updatedChar = null;
        if(char.charCodeAt() != 32){
            updatedChar = char.charCodeAt() + key;
        }else{

Choose MySQL if: You need a fast, reliable database for simpler read-write operations, especially in web applications.
Choose PostgreSQL if: You require advanced SQL features, complex queries, data integrity, and flexibility in data types.
The choice between MySQL and PostgreSQL often depends on the specific requirements of your project, such as scalability needs, data types, level of SQL compliance required, and the complexity of queries and operations.
