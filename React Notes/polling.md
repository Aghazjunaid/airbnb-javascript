Sure! Here's an explanation of short polling and long polling, along with examples in React.

### Short Polling

**Short polling** is a technique where the client repeatedly makes requests to the server at regular intervals to check for new data. This can lead to unnecessary server load and increased latency since requests are sent even when no new data is available.

#### Example of Short Polling in React

```javascript
// ShortPolling.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const ShortPolling = () => {
    const [data, setData] = useState([]);
    const [error, setError] = useState(null);

    const fetchData = async () => {
        try {
            const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
            const result = await response.json();
            setData(result);
        } catch (err) {
            setError(err.message);
        }
    };

    useEffect(() => {
        const interval = setInterval(() => {
            fetchData();
        }, 5000); // Poll every 5 seconds

        return () => clearInterval(interval); // Cleanup on component unmount
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Short Polling Example</h1>
            {error && <p>Error: {error}</p>}
            <ul>
                {data.map(item => (
                    <li key={item.id}>{item.title}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
};

export default ShortPolling;
```

### Long Polling

**Long polling** is a more efficient technique where the client makes a request to the server, and the server holds the request open until new data is available. Once the server responds, the client can immediately send another request. This reduces the number of requests made when data changes infrequently.

#### Example of Long Polling in React

```javascript
// LongPolling.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const LongPolling = () => {
    const [data, setData] = useState([]);
    const [error, setError] = useState(null);

    const fetchData = async () => {
        try {
            const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
            const result = await response.json();
            setData(result);
        } catch (err) {
            setError(err.message);
        }
    };

    const longPoll = async () => {
        while (true) {
            await fetchData();
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000)); // Wait for 5 seconds before polling again
        }
    };

    useEffect(() => {
        longPoll(); // Start long polling

        return () => {
            // Cleanup function if necessary
        };
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Long Polling Example</h1>
            {error && <p>Error: {error}</p>}
            <ul>
                {data.map(item => (
                    <li key={item.id}>{item.title}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
};

export default LongPolling;
```

### Summary

- **Short Polling**: Regular requests sent at fixed intervals. It's simple but can lead to unnecessary load if there's no new data.
- **Long Polling**: Requests are held open until new data is available, making it more efficient.

Long polling is basically a way to keep an HTTP connection open, so you would need to implement this on the server side, your front end cannot control what the server does with the request.

As a side note, long polling is generally much more taxing on the server than websockets, and honestly your time would be better spent implementing a websocket connection, setting up a basic ws server is not that difficult if you use a library such as socket.io

Edit: Just as a semantic note, Long polling is an event driven way for the server to send back responses to the client without the client sending a specific request asking for that data, whereas regular polling is just sending requests at a specific interval (It sounds like you already know this because you mentioned wanting to make your polling more instant).
