Code splitting and lazy loading are both techniques used in web development to improve the performance of applications by reducing the initial load time. While they serve similar purposes, they have different implementations and use cases.

**Code Splitting:**
Code splitting involves breaking down the JavaScript bundle of a web application into smaller chunks, allowing for parts of the code to be loaded only when needed. This helps in reducing the initial load time of the application by loading only the essential code required for the initial view and deferring the loading of non-essential code until later.

**Example of Code Splitting:**
In a React application, you can use dynamic `import()` function to split your code into separate chunks. For example, consider a scenario where you have a dashboard component that is not needed immediately when the application loads:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const App = () => {
    const [showDashboard, setShowDashboard] = useState(false);

    const loadDashboard = async () => {
        const Dashboard = await import('./Dashboard');
        setShowDashboard(<Dashboard />);
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={loadDashboard}>Load Dashboard</button>
            {showDashboard && showDashboard}
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;
```

In the above example, the `Dashboard` component is dynamically imported when the user clicks the "Load Dashboard" button, allowing the application to load the dashboard component only when needed.

**Lazy Loading:**
Lazy loading is a technique where resources (such as images, components, or data) are loaded only when they are needed. This helps in optimizing the initial load time of the application by deferring the loading of non-essential resources until they are required.

**Example of Lazy Loading:**
In a React application, you can use React's `lazy` function along with `Suspense` to lazily load components. For example, you can lazy load a component that is not immediately needed:

```jsx
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

const LazyLoadedComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

const App = () => (
    <div>
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
            <LazyLoadedComponent />
        </Suspense>
    </div>
);

export default App;
```

In the above example, the `LazyComponent` is lazily loaded when it is rendered in the `LazyLoadedComponent`, allowing the application to load the component only when it is needed.

In summary, code splitting involves breaking down the JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks to load only when needed, while lazy loading focuses on loading specific resources only when they are required in the application flow. Both techniques help in optimizing performance and reducing the initial load time of web applications.
